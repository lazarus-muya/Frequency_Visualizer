## üéØ What is Cymatics?

Cymatics is the study of visible sound and vibration. When sound waves interact with particles on a surface, they create intricate geometric patterns. This application simulates this phenomenon by using mathematical models to create Chladni patterns - the beautiful geometric arrangements that form when a plate or membrane vibrates at specific frequencies.

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frequency_visualizer.git
cd frequency_visualizer
```

### Option 2: Download ZIP
1. Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the files to your desired location

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Controls
1. **Frequency Slider**: Adjust the frequency from 1 Hz to 22,000 Hz
2. **Play/Pause Button**: Control audio playback
3. **Sample Rate**: Choose audio quality (44.1 kHz to 192 kHz)
4. **Duration**: Set audio buffer length (0.01s to 1.0s)

### How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Allow audio permissions when prompted
3. Use the frequency slider to explore different frequencies
4. Watch particles form Chladni patterns in real-time
5. Experiment with different sample rates and durations

### Understanding the Patterns
- **Low frequencies** (1-100 Hz): Simple, slow-moving patterns
- **Mid frequencies** (100-1000 Hz): More complex geometric shapes
- **High frequencies** (1000+ Hz): Intricate, rapidly changing patterns
- **Resonant frequencies**: Particles will form clear geometric arrangements

## üîß Technical Details

### Audio Generation
- Uses Web Audio API for high-quality sine wave generation
- Configurable sample rates from 44.1 kHz to 192 kHz
- Adjustable buffer duration for optimal performance
- Volume-limited to 0.1 for comfortable listening

### Particle System
- 2000 particles with physics-based movement
- Particles respond to frequency-dependent vibration patterns
- Mathematical models based on Chladni plate theory
- Real-time rendering at 60 FPS

### Frequency Modes
The application calculates frequency modes (m, n) that determine the pattern formation:
- **m**: Horizontal mode number (1-8)
- **n**: Vertical mode number (1-8)
- Patterns change as frequency increases, creating different geometric arrangements
